Hi World!

I'm Jenni, I have just started to learn coding a few weeks ago and is extremely excited about it.
Couple years ago, I graduated from KAMK (Kajaani UAS) with a BBA in International Business, majoring in Marketing. Half a year later, I started my MDP in Business Competence, also specialized in Marketing. 
Earlier 2016, I decided to start a new path with Business Information System at Haaga-Helia UAS. That's why I'm here today.
